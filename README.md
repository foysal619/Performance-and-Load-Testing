# Performance and Load Testing
In this project I used Apache Jmeter to evaluate the performance of www.mercury-tours.com/San_Francisco_Tours.html website. Checked how the website behaves if we provide Load to it. Applied multiple threads and recorded each HTTP request. 

### In this testing i have generated 
- View Results Tree
- Summarly Report
- Aggregate Report
### I have added the jmx and jtl file of this work. Finally i have generated a html report file using command promt. This is also available in the zip file.

### Technology used
    - Test tool: Apache Jmeter
